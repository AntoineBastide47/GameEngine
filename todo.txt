SDK Changed:
 - Make SDK already contain the static libraries of each vendor item and link to those instead of rebuilding each time, built in debug and release mode
 - Make SDK not come with docs, .github folders and other non code folders

Rendering Changes:
 - Make Renderer2D manage all Renderable2D classes (update and render) and remove ParticleSystemRegistry2D class
 - when an entity goes out of viewport bounds the particle system stops rendering, instead simulate it to a halt and restart it later if it loops

Shader Changes:
 - Create a shader default template with all the uncompacted getters

Create a test suite

Editor Changes:
 - use variable comments for tooltips
 - create in class macros for easier editor rendering changes without needing to override the EditorRendering function
 - add UI for adding/removing components
 - allow component reordering
 - add a Play/Pause button in the scene viewport
 - add a UI pannel for the animator
 - add a UI popup for simulating particle systems when the game isn't running

Known bugs:
 - viewport not resizing as much as possible when maintaining aspect ratio
 - profiler not working
