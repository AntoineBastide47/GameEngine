SDK Changed:
 - Make SDK already contain the static libraries of each vendor item and link to those instead of rebuilding each time, built in debug and release mode

Rendering Changes:
 - Make Renderer2D manage all Renderable2D classes (update and render) and remove ParticleSystemRegistry2D class

Game2D Changes:
 - fix viewport not resizing as much as possible

 - instead of using raw pointers for entities and components use a wrapper so that they can't accidentally be deleted
 - render entity and component pointers in the editor

 - create in class macros for easier editor rendering changes without needing to override the EditorRendering function

 - add UI for adding/removing components
 - allow component reordering

 - add a Play/Pause button in the scene viewport
 - add a UI pannel for the animator
 - add a UI popup for simulating particle systems when the game isn't running
